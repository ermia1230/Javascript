Whenever we want a browser pop up we use the following for instance: 
alert("Hello world)
When we want to print out something in the consloe log, then we write: 
console.log("My name is Ermia)
We can do whatever we want to do in the console of the broweser. On mac: 
Command + Option + j
Javascript is a high-level, object-orianted, multi-paradigm programming language. 
High level since we do not need to for instace think of the abstractions such as memory. 
Reminder of HTML: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lan = "en">
<head>
</head>
</html>
We have the style and the title inside the head. 
We can write our Javascript code in the head as well by doin gthe following: 
<script>
</script>
We can eithere write it that way or we can have a js file where we juct get the js file to the
script using 
<script src = "">
</script>
The scriot command could eithere be in the head or body. It does not matter. 
We can declare variables in two different ways. The first way is to use let and the other way
is to use const. 
const: Variables declared with const are constants. Once assigned a value, the value cannot 
be changed or reassigned. However, for objects and arrays, the properties or elements of the
object or array can be mutated.
Example: 
###########
const pi = 3.14;
pi = 3.14159; // Error: Assignment to constant variable

const myArray = [1, 2, 3];
myArray.push(4); // This is allowed
###########
let: Variables declared with let are mutable. They can be reassigned new values, and the scope
of let variables is limited to the block in which they are defined.
Example:
###########
let x = 5;
x = 10; // This is allowed

if (true) {
    let y = 20;
}
console.log(y); // Error: y is not defined (because it's scoped to the if block)
###########
We should use camelCase for the naming conventions of multiplewords. 
For naming conventions, it is better to not use upper case as the first letter. 
If there is any constant like: 
pi, we write it as PI = 3.14152
