Whenever we want a browser pop up we use the following for instance: 
alert("Hello world)
When we want to print out something in the consloe log, then we write: 
console.log("My name is Ermia)
We can do whatever we want to do in the console of the broweser. On mac: 
Command + Option + j
Javascript is a high-level, object-orianted, multi-paradigm programming language. 
High level since we do not need to for instace think of the abstractions such as memory. 
Reminder of HTML: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lan = "en">
<head>
</head>
</html>
We have the style and the title inside the head. 
We can write our Javascript code in the head as well by doin gthe following: 
<script>
</script>
We can eithere write it that way or we can have a js file where we juct get the js file to the
script using 
<script src = "">
</script>
The scriot command could eithere be in the head or body. It does not matter. 
We can declare variables in two different ways. The first way is to use let and the other way
is to use const. 
const: Variables declared with const are constants. Once assigned a value, the value cannot 
be changed or reassigned. However, for objects and arrays, the properties or elements of the
object or array can be mutated.
Example: 
###########
const pi = 3.14;
pi = 3.14159; // Error: Assignment to constant variable

const myArray = [1, 2, 3];
myArray.push(4); // This is allowed
###########
let: Variables declared with let are mutable. They can be reassigned new values, and the scope
of let variables is limited to the block in which they are defined.
Example:
###########
let x = 5;
x = 10; // This is allowed

if (true) {
    let y = 20;
}
console.log(y); // Error: y is not defined (because it's scoped to the if block)
###########
As it can be seen above, we can modify an array if we have declared the array using const. 
Ottherwise, if it is a primitive value, we can not change it later on. 
We should use camelCase for the naming conventions of multiplewords. 
For naming conventions, it is better to not use upper case as the first letter. 
If there is any constant like: 
pi, we write it as PI = 3.14152
In Javascript, values are eithere objects or primitives. 
We have 7 different primitive datatypes in Javascript: 
1- Numbers --> Integers or decimals. (All numbers are of the type number).
2- String --> text. (We use '' or "" to declare them).
3- Boolean --> True or False. 
4- Undefined --> Unlike other programming languages, we have undefined in Javascript. Undefined
is basically a value taken by a variable that is not yet defined. for instance: 
let children;
5- Null --> This means also empty value. Show descripttion below for the differences between 
null and unkown. 
6- Symbol --> Value that is unique and can not be changed. (Not very useful). (ES2015)
7- BigInt --> The large integers than the Number type can hold. 
The difference between undefined and null:
undefined: When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, it is said to have an 
"undefined" value. Also, the value returned by a function that doesn't explicitly return 
anything is undefined. It indicates the absence of a value.
########
let x;
console.log(x); // undefined

function foo() {}
console.log(foo()); // undefined
########
null: null is explicitly assigned to a variable to represent the absence of any value or an 
empty value. It is often used as a placeholder to indicate that a variable or object property 
intentionally does not have a value.
Example: 
########
let y = null;
console.log(y); // null
########
Javascript has dynamic typing. We do not need to manuaelly define the datatype, and Javascript
will automatically define the datatype itself. 
In Javascript, variables do not have a type, and it is only values that have a type. 
We can also assign a new datatype to an already declared variable in Javascript. This is due 
to the power of the dynamic typing. 
Javascript is excuted from top to bottom, line by line. 
In Javascript, in order to see the type of a value, we use use typeof
########
console.log(typeof (ermia));
########
When we declare variables using const, we can not just leave it empty. In other words, we
can not do the following: 
########
const ermia;
########
Var is the third way to decalre variables. We should aviod using var to declare 
variables. It works the same as let. 
var is one of the ways to declare variables in JavaScript. However, it behaves differently 
from const and let in terms of scope and hoisting.
Function scope: Variables declared with var are function-scoped. This means that they are
visible throughout the entire function in which they are declared.
########
function example() {
    if (true) {
        var x = 10;
    }
    console.log(x); // 10 - x is accessible here
}
########
Hoisting: Variable declarations using var are hoisted to the top of their containing function 
or script. This means that the variable declaration is moved to the top of its scope during 
the compilation phase, but the assignment remains in place.
########
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 10;
// This will be excuted in the following way:
var x;
console.log(x); // undefined
x = 10;
########
Redeclaration: Variables declared with var can be redeclared within the same scope without 
causing an error.
Global scope: If var is used outside of any function, the variable becomes a property of 
the global object (in a web browser, the global object is window).
Due to its hoisting behavior and lack of block scope, using var can sometimes lead to 
unexpected behavior and make code harder to understand and maintain. That's why const
and let are generally preferred for variable declarations in modern JavaScript code. 
They provide block scope, prevent accidental redeclaration, and reduce the likelihood 
of bugs.
When doing the following: 
########
ermia = 10;
########
We are not decalring ermia here. In this case, JavaScript creats a property on the global 
object.
